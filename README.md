Market Segmentation Introduction

Market segmentation is the practice of dividing a market into smaller segments based on criteria like demographics, psychographics, behaviour, and geography. It plays a key role in both strategic and tactical marketing. While it offers benefits such as personalized marketing and resource efficiency, it also comes with costs related to research and campaign customization.

Market Segmentation Analysis

Market segmentation involves dividing a larger market into smaller segments based on criteria like demographics, geography, psychographics, and behaviour.
Two approaches: Organizational constraints (resources, capacity) and choice of segmentation variables (relevant factors).
Data-driven segmentation uses data collection and analysis for precise customer identification.
The market segmentation process includes defining objectives, data collection, choosing criteria, segmenting, profiling, evaluating, targeting, implementing, and continuous monitoring and adaptation.

Nine Steps of Market Segmentation Analysis

Step 1: Deciding (not) to Segment

Implications of Committing to Market Segmentation: Committing to market segmentation offers benefits like targeted marketing, improved customer understanding, resource allocation, and competitive advantage.
Implementation Barriers: Implementing segmentation can be hindered by data challenges, resource constraints, resistance to change, and shifting market dynamics.
Before embracing market segmentation, assess data availability, required resources, stakeholder alignment, long-term viability, and the competitive landscape.

Step 2: Specifying the Ideal Target Segment
Defining parameters like demographics, geography, psychographics, and behaviours to comprehensively assess potential segments, aiding informed decisions.
Identifying factors that eliminate certain segments from consideration, streamlining decision-making and resource allocation.
Assessing market size, growth potential, competition, and profitability to prioritize segments with long-term potential.
Emphasizing a systematic approach involving market research, data collection, and analysis to minimize subjective biases and base decisions on solid data.
Providing a practical tool to ensure thorough consideration of all elements in specifying the ideal target segment, maintaining organization and thoroughness in the strategic planning process.

Step 3: Collecting Data
Segmentation variables encompass geographic, socio-demographic, psychographic, and behavioural factors.
Segmentation criteria further define these variables, including geographic, socio-demographic, psychographic, and behavioural criteria.
Geographic segmentation involves location-based factors.
Socio-demographic criteria consider age, gender, income, and education.
Psychographic criteria delve into attitudes, values, lifestyle, and personality traits.
Behavioural criteria focus on customer actions and responses to products.
Data is gathered through survey studies, involving the choice of variables, response options, response styles, and sample size considerations.
Internal sources, like sales data and customer records, provide valuable data for segmentation.
Experimental studies involve controlled experiments to understand customer preferences and decision-making.

Step 4: Exploring Data
Initial data familiarization, structure understanding, and issue identification.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
Descriptive Analysis: Utilizing statistics and visualization to explore data distribution and characteristics.
Pre-Processing: Data preparation, addressing categorical and numeric variables separately.
Categorical Variables: Strategies for handling categorical data.
Numeric Variables: Addressing numeric data, including normalization and scaling.
Principal Components Analysis: Introduction to PCA as a dimensionality reduction technique.

Step 5: Extracting Segments
Simplifying complex data by effectively grouping consumers.
Assessing similarity, using measures, hierarchical, partitioning, and hybrid methods.
Using finite mixtures of distributions and regressions for segmentation.
Exploring biclustering, variable selection, and reduction techniques.
Assessing segment quality and reliability with cluster indices, gorge plots, and stability analysis.

Step 6: Profiling Segments
This step involves effectively profiling market segments using traditional and visual approaches, identifying defining characteristics, and assessing segment separation. The checklist aids in a structured process.

Step 7: Describing Segments
This step involves creating a comprehensive understanding of market segments using visualizations and statistical methods to describe and predict differences. It includes developing a full picture of market segments, visualizations, testing for differences, and predicting segments.

Step 8: Selecting (the) Target Segment(s)
In this step, the process of choosing the ideal target segment is explored. It involves market segment evaluation and is aided by a checklist to guide the selection process.

Step 9: Customising the Marketing Mix
This step examines how market segmentation impacts the marketing mix, covering product, price, place, and promotion. It includes understanding implications, customizing each element, and a checklist for thorough implementation.
